## Quick Deployment (5 Steps, 30 Minutes)

### 1. Push to GitHub (5 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/Missbach/Desktop/claude/meta

# Create GitHub repo (if not done)
# Visit github.com/new and create: austrian-research-metadata

# Set remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/austrian-research-metadata.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# Verify
# Visit: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/austrian-research-metadata
```

**Expected**: All files visible on GitHub repository

### 2. Create Railway Account (2 minutes)

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click "Start a New Project" (free tier)
3. Sign in with GitHub

**Expected**: Railway dashboard accessible

### 3. Deploy from GitHub (5 minutes)

1. Click "Create New Project" in Railway
2. Select "Deploy from GitHub"
3. Authorize Railway to access your GitHub
4. Select `austrian-research-metadata` repository
5. Click "Deploy"

**Expected**: Railway begins building Docker image

### 4. Configure Environment (2 minutes)

In Railway dashboard → Project → Variables:

```
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./data/armp.db
ENVIRONMENT=production
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

**Expected**: Variables saved, build continues

### 5. Verify Deployment (5 minutes)

Wait for build to complete (2-3 minutes), then:

```bash
# Get URL from Railway dashboard (like: your-app.railway.app)
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/organizations | head -20
```

**Expected**: HTTP 200 responses with JSON data

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify with these tests:

### 1. Health Check (30 seconds)

```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health
# Should return: {"status":"healthy", "database":"connected", ...}
```

### 2. Web Interface (1 minute)

Visit in browser:
```
https://your-app.railway.app/
```

**Check**:
- Page loads without errors
- CSS styling applied (Tailwind)
- Navigation menu works
- Responsive on mobile

### 3. API Endpoints (2 minutes)

```bash
# All should return HTTP 200 with JSON
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/organizations
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/publications?limit=5
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/researchers
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/projects
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/analytics/trends
```

### 4. API Documentation (1 minute)

Visit:
```
https://your-app.railway.app/docs
```

**Check**:
- Swagger UI loads
- All 37+ endpoints listed
- Interactive "Try it out" works

### 5. Logs (1 minute)

In Railway dashboard → Logs:
- Look for: `INFO: Uvicorn running on 0.0.0.0:8000`
- Look for: `✓ Database initialized`
- **Avoid**: Any ERROR or CRITICAL messages

**Total Verification**: ~5-10 minutes

## Database & Data

### Current State: Empty (Ready for Harvest)

```
Organizations: 15 (pre-configured Austrian universities)
Publications: 0 (ready to harvest)
Researchers: 0 (ready to extract)
Projects: 0 (ready to harvest)
```

### Optional: Load Sample Data

After deployment, load sample data via Railway shell:

```bash
# In Railway dashboard: click container → Shell tab

# Initialize database (creates tables)
python -c "from app.database import init_db; init_db()"

# Harvest sample publications (~5 minutes)
python scripts/harvest_openaire.py --max-records 500
python scripts/harvest_crossref.py --max-records 500

# Extract researchers (~1 minute)
python scripts/enrich_researchers.py

# Harvest FWF projects (~1 minute)
python scripts/harvest_fwf.py --max-records 100
```

After this, all API endpoints will return real data.

## Monitoring & Logs

### Railway Dashboard

Access at: https://railway.app/dashboard

**Key Metrics**:
- Deployment status (should be "success")
- Container logs (check for errors)
- CPU/Memory usage (should be <500MB)
- Network (requests/responses)
- Deployments history

### View Logs

```bash
# Via Railway CLI
railway logs --follow

# Or: View in dashboard → Logs tab
```

**What to look for**:
```
✅ GOOD:
INFO: 🚀 Starting Austrian Research Metadata Platform API...
INFO: ✓ Database initialized
INFO: Application startup complete
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000

❌ BAD:
ERROR: ModuleNotFoundError
ERROR: sqlite3.DatabaseError
ERROR: Connection refused
CRITICAL: Unhandled exception
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### App Won't Start

**Error**: "Application failed to start"

**Check**:
1. Railway logs for specific error
2. Environment variables set correctly
3. Python version (should be 3.11)

**Fix**:
```bash
# Re-deploy with clean slate
git push origin main  # Trigger Railway redeploy
```

### Slow Performance

**Symptoms**: API calls take >5 seconds

**Cause**: SQLite doesn't handle concurrent requests well

**Solution for MVP**:
- This is expected for SQLite
- Upgrade to PostgreSQL for production (Phase 3c)

**Temporary Fix**:
- Set Railway to 1 replica (no load balancing)
- Or: Reduce concurrent users in beta

### Database Errors

**Error**: "sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked"

**Cause**: Multiple processes accessing SQLite simultaneously

**Solution**:
- Migrate to PostgreSQL (Phase 3c)
- Or: Keep Railway at 1 replica

### High Memory Usage

**Symptoms**: Container using >500MB

**Cause**: Large data harvest in progress

**Solution**:
- Upgrade Railway plan ($10-50/month)
- Or: Reduce data harvest size
- Or: Switch to PostgreSQL (more efficient)
