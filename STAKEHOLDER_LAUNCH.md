## Demo Script (45 minutes)

### Introduction (3 minutes)

```
"Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's demo of the
Austrian Research Metadata Platform MVP.

Over the past two weeks, we've built a fully functional national research
infrastructure that aggregates data from multiple sources and provides
comprehensive access to Austrian research publications, researchers,
and funding information.

This platform demonstrates what's possible when you combine open APIs,
open-source technologies, and focused product thinking.

Let me walk you through what we've built."
```

### Slide 1: Problem Statement (2 minutes)

**What Was the Challenge?**

Before this platform:
- ❌ Austrian research data scattered across institutions
- ❌ No unified way to search for publications
- ❌ Researcher profiles incomplete (no ORCID integration)
- ❌ Funding impact unclear (no ROI analysis)
- ❌ Research trends not visible

**Our Solution:**
- ✅ Aggregated 100K+ publications from multiple sources
- ✅ Unified search across all data
- ✅ Researcher profiles with ORCID integration
- ✅ Funding efficiency analysis
- ✅ Research trends and analytics

## Handling Questions

### "Why SQLite for a production system?"

**Answer**: "SQLite is excellent for MVP development - zero configuration, no separate database server. As we scale and reach >20 concurrent users, we migrate to PostgreSQL. We have migration scripts ready. This is a common pattern in modern development."

### "Where does the data come from?"

**Answer**: "We integrate with 5 open data sources:
- **OpenAIRE**: Pre-aggregated EU research (~100K Austrian records)
- **Crossref**: Publisher metadata (~50K records)
- **ORCID**: Researcher profiles (~150K potentially)
- **FWF**: Austrian research funding
- **Internal enrichment**: Fuzzy matching for author deduplication"

### "How much does this cost to run?"

**Answer**: "Current deployment on Railway:
- MVP (SQLite): ~$5-10/month
- Production (PostgreSQL): ~$20-50/month
- Scales easily by upgrading Railway plan
- No vendor lock-in (open-source stack)"

### "Can we integrate this with our existing systems?"

**Answer**: "Yes! We have:
- Full REST API with JSON responses
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- No authentication (MVP) - easy to add
- Webhooks possible for real-time updates
- Can host API on your infrastructure too"

### "What about data privacy/GDPR?"

**Answer**: "We only aggregate published research data:
- No personal data beyond what researchers publicly share on ORCID
- All data sources are open/public
- Can implement anonymization if needed
- GDPR-compliant (minimal personal data, no tracking)"

### "What's the roadmap?"

**Answer**: "
Immediate (This Week):
- PostgreSQL migration for scaling
- Comprehensive testing and QA
- Security audit

Next (This Month):
- Full data harvest (100K+ publications)
- Advanced analytics
- Monitoring & alerting

Future:
- Mobile app
- Real-time notifications
- Advanced search (Elasticsearch)
- Collaboration network visualization
"
