## 🔗 Integration Points (Future)

The platform is designed to integrate with:
- **RIS Synergy standardized APIs** - Once institutional endpoints operational
- **FWF Research Radar** - Project funding data
- **OpenAIRE** - European research infrastructure
- **ORCID** - International researcher identifiers
- **National institutional repositories** - Direct OAI-PMH harvesting

## 📖 Key Documentation

- **QUICKSTART.md** - For quick demos (15 minutes)
- **DEVELOPMENT.md** - For developers (complete technical guide)
- **README.md** - For project overview
- **API Docs** - Available at `/docs` once running

## ✍️ Recommendations

### To Stakeholders
"We have demonstrated that Austrian research metadata aggregation is achievable with open-source tools and public APIs in just 4 hours of development. The system is ready for beta testing with real Austrian data and can be deployed publicly within one week."

### To Development Team
"Continue with Phase 1c (Web Interface) immediately. The technical foundation is solid and can support all planned features through Phase 3. No architectural redesign needed."

### For RIS Synergy Integration
"Once institutional APIs are operational, this platform can be extended to use them directly. The current open-API approach validates the concept while institutional systems mature."

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Phase 1b is **SUCCESSFUL** because:
- ✅ All planned components built on schedule
- ✅ API is fully functional with real data capability
- ✅ No major blockers or issues
- ✅ Documentation is comprehensive
- ✅ Code quality is high and maintainable
- ✅ Ready for immediate stakeholder demonstration
- ✅ Foundation supports all planned future phases
