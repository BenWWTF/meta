## Deployment Paths

### 🚀 FASTEST: Deploy Right Now

```bash
# 1. Ensure code is committed
git status  # Should show "nothing to commit"

# 2. Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# 3. Go to railway.app → Create Project → Deploy from GitHub

# 4. Wait 3-5 minutes for build

# 5. Visit public URL from Railway dashboard

# Done! Your MVP is live!
```

⏱️ **Time**: 15-20 minutes

👉 **Full guide**: `PHASE1D_DEPLOYMENT.md`

---

### 🧪 SAFE: Test First, Then Deploy

```bash
# 1. Create virtual environment
python3.11 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Initialize database
python -c "from app.database import init_db; init_db()"

# 4. Start app locally
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# 5. Test in browser: http://localhost:8000

# 6. Run tests
pytest tests/ -v

# 7. Then deploy (see FASTEST path above)
```

⏱️ **Time**: 45 minutes to 1 hour

👉 **Full guide**: `QUICKSTART.md` + `TEST_LOCALLY.md`

---

### 📈 SCALABLE: Deploy with PostgreSQL

```bash
# 1. Deploy to Railway (see FASTEST above)

# 2. Add PostgreSQL plugin in Railway dashboard
# (Railway auto-creates DB and sets DATABASE_URL)

# 3. Set up schema
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... python scripts/migrate_schema.py

# 4. Migrate data (optional if you have existing SQLite data)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... python scripts/migrate_data.py

# 5. Verify migration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... python scripts/verify_migration.py

# 6. Redeploy app on Railway

# Now you're running PostgreSQL, ready for 50+ users!
```

⏱️ **Time**: 1-2 hours after initial deployment
